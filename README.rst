UC Dash
********
A completely inadequate job tracking tool
-----------------------------------------


UC Dash (or Universal Camo Dashboard) is going to be a django project for tracking job status. The
original idea occurred to me after playing with Hudson's ability to accept XML notifications from
external tasks to report on them. But obviously, Hudson's main focus is on builds.

So UC Dash is designed to accept notifications from various external jobs and provide a dashboard that
reports on the status of those jobs.

Universal Camo is in reference to the Army's ACU that uses their universal camo that has turned out to be
a relative failure and is now being replaced. So like the Army's universal camo, this project will likely
follow in its steps.
